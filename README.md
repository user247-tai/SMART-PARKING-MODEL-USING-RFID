# SMART-PARKING-MODEL-USING-RFID
This project offers a smart parking model that can control the number of vehicles in the parking lot and coordinate the number of vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot automatically, helping to reduce unnecessary labor.
Summary of results:
- The cost of building a model is not expensive. The components to build the model are cheap components.
- Although the construction cost is not expensive, the construction model has worked effectively and with high accuracy.
- The model has errors, but the errors are not significant and can be accepted.
- This is still just a model, the actual application of building a real-sized smart parking lot may face greater difficulties and obstacles.
